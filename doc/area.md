The area generator produces an area defined by a *topline* and a *baseline* as in an area chart. Typically, the two lines share the same [*x*-values](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_shape/latest/d4_shape/Area/x.html) ([x0](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_shape/latest/d4_shape/Area/x0.html) = [x1](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_shape/latest/d4_shape/Area/x1.html)), differing only in *y*-value ([y0](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_shape/latest/d4_shape/Area/y0.html) and [y1](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_shape/latest/d4_shape/Area/y1.html)); most commonly, y0 is defined as a constant representing zero (the y scaleâ€™s output for zero). The *topline* is defined by x1 and y1 and is rendered first; the *baseline* is defined by x0 and y0 and is rendered second with the points in reverse order. With a [curveLinear](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_shape/latest/d4_shape/curveLinear.html) [curve](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_shape/latest/topics/Curves-topic.html), this produces a clockwise polygon.
