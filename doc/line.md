The line generator produces a [spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)) or [polyline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_chain) as in a line chart. Lines also appear in many other visualization types, such as the links in [hierarchical edge bundling](https://observablehq.com/@d3/hierarchical-edge-bundling). See also [radial lines](https://pub.dev/documentation/d4_shape/latest/topics/Radial%20lines-topic.html).
